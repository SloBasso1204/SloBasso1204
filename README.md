- Hi, my name is Steve and I have been helping to place software developers at top firms for over 15 years.
- Iâ€™m interested in building a relationship with developers to help understand what their future career goals are and how I can help them achieve them. I specialize in SDE/FEE roles and can be a true advocate for you when you are ready for your next role.
